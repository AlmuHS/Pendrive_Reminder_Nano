# Pendrive_Reminder_Nano

Based in [Pendrive Reminder](https://github.com/AlmuHS/Pendrive_Reminder)

## About

This is a reimplementation of [Pendrive Reminder](https://github.com/AlmuHS/Pendrive_Reminder), with a simpler structure.

In this version, the UDev rules are replaced by a simple UDisks query.
Thus we can check the pendrive existence easily that the original implementation, and detect more problematic situation than before

## Disadvantages

  -  This version doesn't support polkit < 0.106
  -  Less efficient than previous version
  -  There is no notification to advice when a device has been connected or disconnected.


## Advantages
	
  - Supports more usecase than previous version
     - Now we can detect the pendrive connection made before system start.
     - Don't matter when and how the desktop session is started: the dbus client will be always available

  - GNU/Linux
  - polkit >= 0.106
  - udisks2
  - libnotify
